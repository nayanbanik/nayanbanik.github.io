Hi! I’m Nayan, currently pursuing my [PhD in Engineering (Computer Science)](https://uwm.edu/engineering/departments/computer-science/) at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee (UWM), USA. As a part of [Biorobotics Laboratory](https://sites.uwm.edu/biorobotics-lab/), my research goal is to contribute to assistive technologies to build smart rehab solutions that can help patients with motor dysfunctions. I am also working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) in Computer Science Department at UWM. Besides my current role, I am on study leave as an [Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering](http://cou.ac.bd/cse) at Comilla University, Bangladesh. I’m an interpretive social scientist by training with enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. My research, teaching, and broader service are all grounded in the idea that science and technology are inherently social activities, which are directed, operated, and maintained in certain ways (and not in other ways), by people in and outside of institutions.

## My background and history
I received my M.Sc (Engg.) and B.Sc (Engg.) from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cou.ac.bd/cse) at Comilla University, Bangladesh. After completing my bachelor's, I started working as a Lecturer at Prime University, Bangladesh. After that, I completed my Master's and worked as a Lecturer at the Green University of Bangladesh. I joined Comilla University as a Lecturer of CSE in December 2019 and got promoted to Assistant Professor on Jun2, 2022.

## My intellectual communities
I’m a disciplinary nomad, integrating disciplines like computer science, information science, social psychology, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a qualitative ethnographer, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods. I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
